			I don't know you, but I want you<br />
			All the more for that<br />
			Words fall through me and always fool me<br />
			And I can't react<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			And games that never amount<br />
			To more than they're meant<br />
			Will play themselves out<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			Take this sinking boat and point it home<br />
			We've still got time<br />
			Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice<br />
			You've made it now<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			Falling slowly, eyes that know me<br />
			And I can't go back<br />
			The moods that take me and erase me<br />
			And I'm painted black<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, you have suffered enough<br />
			And warred with yourself<br />
			It's time that you won<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			Take this sinking boat and point it home<br />
			We've still got time<br />
			Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice<br />
			You've made it now<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			Falling slowly sing your melody<br />
			I'll sing it loud<br />
		</p>
