        <p>
            I'm not strong enough to stay away</br>
            I Can't run from you</br>
            I'd just run back to you</br>
            Like a moth I'm drawn into your flame</br>
            You say my name but it's not the same</br>
            You look in my eyes</br>
            I'm stripped of my pride</br>
            And my soul surrenders</br>
            And you bring my heart to its knees
        </p>
        <p>
            And it's killing me when you're away</br>
            And I wanna leave</br>
            And I wanna stay</br>
            And I'm so confused</br>
            So hard to choose between the pleasure and the pain</br>
            And I know it's wrong</br>
            And I know it's right</br>
            And even if I tried to win the fight</br>
            My heart would overrule my mind</br>
            And I'm not strong enough to stay away
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not strong enough to stay away</br>
            What can I do</br>
            I would die without you</br>
            In your presence my heart knows no shame</br>
            I'm not to blame</br>
            'Cause you bring my heart to its knees
        </p>
        <p>
            And it's killing me when you're away</br>
            And I wanna leave</br>
            And I wanna stay</br>
            And I'm so confused</br>
            So hard to choose between the pleasure and the pain</br>
            And I know it's wrong</br>
            And I know it's right</br>
            And even if I tried to win the fight</br>
            My heart would overrule my mind</br>
            And I'm not strong enough to stay away
        </p>
        <p>
            There's nothing I can do</br>
            My heart is chained to you</br>
            And I can't get free</br>
            Look what this love has done to me
        </p>
        <p>
            'Cause it's killing me when you're away</br>
            And I wanna leave</br>
            And I wanna stay</br>
            And I'm so confused</br>
            So hard to choose between the pleasure and the pain</br>
            And I know it's wrong</br>
            And I know it's right</br>
            And even if I tried to win the fight</br>
            My heart would overrule my mind</br>
            And I'm not strong enough to stay away
